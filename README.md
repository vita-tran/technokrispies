### Project Overview

* Allow users to input their perscribed medication names from the a reliable [Drug Information API](https://rapidapi.com/rnelsomain/api/drug-info-and-price-history/) to source out accurate information. 
* Users input frequency & (optional: dosages depending on what kind of medication it is and if it is required in the notification).
* Get user's preference for notification type (Note for team: refer bcak to this later - take into consideration the audience for the app).
